Liri bot,

The program will take a few basic arguements,

* `my-tweets` which will print recent tweets from a dummy twitter account.

* `spotify-this-song` + 'song' will output information about the song's artist, its name, a preview link from spotify and the album the song is from.

* `movie-this` + 'MovieTitle' will output information regarding the imdb, rotten tomatoes ratings, country of origin, and other misc information such as actors.

* `do-what-it-says` Should just output spotify this song but for an unspecified track.

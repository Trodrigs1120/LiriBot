This is Liri bot, it exists for basic node js practice. It will use the Spotify, Twitter, and Request Node npm modules, as well as the omdb api to pull movie information.

The program will take a few basic arguements,

* `my-tweets` which will print recent tweets from a dummy twitter account.

* `spotify-this-song` + 'song' will output information about the song's artist, its name, a preview link from spotify and the album the song is from.

* `movie-this` + 'MovieTitle' will output information regarding the imdb, rotten tomatoes ratings, country of origin, and other misc information such as actors.
	(If the movie has a 2 part title. Enter it like "Pulp+Fiction")

* `do-what-it-says` Should just output spotify this song but for an unspecified track (which can be changed by changing random.txt)
